# 6. File and Directory Permissions

    # Objective: Work with file and directory permissions.

    # Write a script to check the permissions of a file (subdirectories.txt created earlier).
    # Modify the permissions to make the file read-only.
    # Verify the change and handle an exception if the file cannot be modified afterward.
