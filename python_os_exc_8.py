# 8. Advanced: Path Handling

    # Objective: Practice working with paths and navigating file structures.

    # Write a script to find the absolute path of a file named file1.txt in the current directory.
    # Check whether this path is a file or a directory.
    # Split the absolute path into its components (e.g., drive, folders, file).
